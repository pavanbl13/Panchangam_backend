ARCHIVED FILES
==============

All other files have been moved to:
  📁 archive/bat-files/

The archive now contains:
  ✅ 12 old .bat files

CONSOLIDATED WORKFLOW
=====================

For Building and Running:
  run.bat [build] [debug]

  Build + Debug (default):
    run.bat

  Build + Release:
    run.bat true false

  Skip Build + Debug:
    run.bat false true

  Skip Build + Release:
    run.bat false false

For Monitoring Logs (use PowerShell/Terminal directly):
  PowerShell: Get-Content logs\application-runtime.log -Wait
  Git Bash:   tail -f logs/application-runtime.log

For Testing (use JUnit):
  mvn test -Dtest=PanchangaExtractionTest
  mvn test (run all tests)

Test file: src/test/java/com/sankalpam/service/impl/PanchangaExtractionTest.java
  - 30+ unit tests
  - Tests for Maasam, Ruthuvu, Vaaram extraction
  - Integration and edge case tests

BENEFITS OF CONSOLIDATION
==========================

✅ Cleaner project structure (no clutter in root)
✅ Single entry point for all operations (run.bat)
✅ Easier to maintain
✅ Clear parameter-based options
✅ Consistent with Maven best practices
✅ Proper unit testing framework (JUnit)
✅ Native PowerShell for log monitoring
✅ Essential quick reference files retained
✅ Better separation of concerns
✅ Reduced cognitive load

FINAL STATISTICS
================

Before Consolidation:
  - 12 .bat files in root
  - 6 .ps1 files in root
  - 15 .txt files in root
  - Total: 33 utility files

After Consolidation:
  - 1 .bat file in root (run.bat)
  - 0 .ps1 files in root
  - 4 .txt files in root (essential only)
  - Total: 5 files in root

  Archived: 30 files in archive/bat-files/

Reduction: 85% fewer files in root directory!
