QUICK START GUIDE - RUN.BAT
===========================

THREE WAYS TO RUN:

1. DEBUG MODE (Dual View - Recommended for Development)
   Command: run.bat
   Command: run.bat debug
   Command: run.bat true

   Result:
   - Opens 2 windows
   - Window 1: Green console with app logs
   - Window 2: Cyan log viewer with live updates
   - Perfect for testing with Postman

2. RELEASE MODE (Single Window - for Production Testing)
   Command: run.bat release
   Command: run.bat false

   Result:
   - Opens 1 window only
   - Simple console output
   - No separate log viewer

3. JUST BUILD (No Run)
   Command: mvn clean install -DskipTests

   Result:
   - Builds JAR file only
   - Doesn't start application
   - Takes ~9 seconds


BUILD FLOW:
-----------
Step 1: Maven clean install -DskipTests         (9 seconds)
Step 2: Prepare environment                     (2 seconds)
  - Create logs directory
  - Check/kill existing process on port 8081
Step 3: Start application in chosen mode        (Immediate)


WHAT YOU GET:

Debug Mode:
  Console Window (Green)
  - Real-time Spring Boot startup messages
  - Application logs as requests come in

  Log Viewer Window (Cyan)
  - Color-coded logs from file
  - Green = INFO messages
  - Yellow = WARNINGS
  - Red = ERRORS
  - Cyan = HTTP POST requests
  - White = Other logs

Release Mode:
  Console Window (Single)
  - All logs in one place
  - Clean output
  - Standard terminal

APPLICATION READY WHEN:
- Both/One windows open
- See "Tomcat started" message
- Port 8081 is listening


TESTING YOUR APP:
-----------------

Health Check:
  curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
  OR
  Postman: GET http://localhost:8081/actuator/health

Sample API Call:
  Postman: POST http://localhost:8081/api/find
  Body: {
    "fullName": "Test User",
    "city": "Bangalore",
    "date": "2026-02-24",
    "time": "15:30"
  }

STOPPING THE APP:
- Press Ctrl+C in the console window
- Or close the console window
- Or run: taskkill /F /IM java.exe


TROUBLESHOOTING:

Q: Build fails
A: Check Java version (needs 21+)
   Check Maven (needs 3.8+)
   Check internet (needs to download deps)

Q: Port 8081 in use
A: Script auto-kills existing process
   If not, manually: netstat -ano | findstr :8081

Q: Logs not showing in viewer
A: Check if logs directory was created
   Check if JAR file was built

Q: App won't start
A: Check console window for errors
   Try: java -jar target/sankalpam-api-1.0.0.jar


KEY FEATURES ENABLED:
- Tests SKIPPED during build (faster)
- Automatic port cleanup
- Dual view option for development
- Simple mode for production
- Color-coded log viewer
- Error handling and feedback


KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
-------------------
Ctrl+C     - Stop application
Ctrl+L     - Clear console (in log viewer)
Ctrl+K     - Clear screen (varies by terminal)
